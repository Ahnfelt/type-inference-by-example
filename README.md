I'm Joakim Ahnfelt-Rønne, MSc Computer Science (University of Copenhagen). I work with functional programming in the industry and I co-organize a meetup about it in Copenhagen. In my spare time, I work on programming languages - and apparently, blog about it.

Catch me on https://discord.gg/e3B3hW - it's a very nice community about programming language design. I'm @ahnfelt.
